# Daily LeetCode Challenge 

## Overview
Welcome to the Daily LeetCode Challenge! This initiative is designed to help sharpen your problem-solving skills by tackling one LeetCode problem daily using **C++**. By the end of this challenge, you'll have strengthened your understanding of data structures, algorithms, and programming fundamentals.

## Goals
My personal goal for this challenge is:
- To solve one problem daily and share the solution on Instagram (@code1aday).
- To document the thought process, provide concise explanations, and inspire others to start their coding journey.
- To improve problem-solving speed and accuracy in preparation for competitive programming and technical interviews.

## Challenge Structure
### Plan for Each Day:
1. **Choose the Problem**: A problem from LeetCode, spanning beginner to advanced levels.
2. **Solve It in C++**: Write an optimized solution.
3. **Create Instagram Reel**:
    - Briefly explain the problem and solution.
    - Share insights, tips, or challenges faced.
4. **Post Daily**:
    - Include the problem description, solution, and a motivational caption.

### January Schedule
